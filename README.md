# OscMackieControl

The small software that map the midi implementation of Mackie Control to OSC protocol.
It allows you to control any DAW with any OSC capable hardware.

## Building
It is a Qt5 project, technically, just open and compile the project.

## Installation
This program is not able to create its own virtual midi port to communicate with the DAW so you need to create them by yourself. See the wiki to know how to do that on Windows and Mac OS.
